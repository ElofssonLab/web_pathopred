THIS FOLDER CONTAINS ALL THE PREDICTIONs FOR THESE ORGANISMS:
 
	1 - Caenorhabditis elegans 
	2 - Danio rerio
	3 - Drosophila melanogaster
	4 - Gallus Domesticus
	5 - Mus musculus


To obtain the prediction we run SubCons using only sequences from 
Swissprot (March 2017). This is the reason of fewer protein for some
organism.
